These default coding systems were tried to encode text
in the buffer â€˜edt-x11-keysâ€™:
  (utf-8-unix (1386 . 4194175) (1408 . 4194176) (1413 . 4194303))
However, each of them encountered characters it couldnâ€™t encode:
  utf-8-unix cannot encode these: ø¿½¿ € ÿ

Click on a character (or switch to this window by â€˜C-x oâ€™
and select the characters by RET) to jump to the place it appears,
where â€˜M-x universal-argument C-x =â€™ will give information about it.

Select one of the safe coding systems listed below,
or cancel the writing with C-g and edit the buffer
   to remove or modify the problematic characters,
or specify any other coding system (and risk losing
   the problematic characters).
