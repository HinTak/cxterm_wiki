#!/usr/bin/emacs --script

; This is a failure. Kept as a scripting example.

; emacs --script does not accept co-operations with any any other arguments. (-nw, -Q, etc)
;     It seems also to imply --batch.
; --script is a short-cut for "--batch -l", and --batch implies -q.

; emacs --script was introduced in emacs 22.
