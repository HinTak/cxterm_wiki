!     $ xmodmap -pke | grep 'Mode_switch'

!     keycode  22 = BackSpace BackSpace BackSpace BackSpace
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! cxterm seems to interprete BackSpace and Delete key in the opposite sense
! as the rest of xterm. Hence it is a very bad idea to remap either, as xmodmap
! changes applies across the whole of X11.

!       keycode NUMBER = KEYSYMNAME ...
!               The list of keysyms is assigned to the indicated keycode (which
!               may be specified in decimal, hex or octal and can be determined
!               by  running  the  xev program).  Up to eight keysyms may be at-
!               tached to a key, however the last four are not used in any  ma-
!               jor  X server implementation.  The first keysym is used when no
!               modifier key is pressed in conjunction with this key, the  sec-
!               ond with Shift, the third when the Mode_switch key is used with
!               this key and the fourth when both  the  Mode_switch  and  Shift
!               keys are used.

!       keycode any = KEYSYMNAME ...
!               If  no  existing key has the specified list of keysyms assigned
!               to it, a spare key on the keyboard is selected and the  keysyms
!               are  assigned  to  it.  The list of keysyms may be specified in
!               decimal, hex or octal.

!       keysym KEYSYMNAME = KEYSYMNAME ...
!               The KEYSYMNAME on the left hand side is translated into  match-
!               ing  keycodes  used to perform the corresponding set of keycode
!               expressions.  Note that if the same keysym is bound to multiple
!               keys, the expression is executed for each matching keycode.


!       clear MODIFIERNAME
!               This removes all entries in the modifier map for the given mod-
!               ifier, where valid name are: Shift, Lock, Control, Mod1,  Mod2,
!               Mod3,  Mod4,  and Mod5 (case does not matter in modifier names,
!               although it does matter for all  other  names).   For  example,
!               ``clear  Lock'' will remove all any keys that were bound to the
!               shift lock modifier.

!       add MODIFIERNAME = KEYSYMNAME ...
!               This adds all keys containing the given keysyms  to  the  indi-
!               cated  modifier  map.  The keysym names are evaluated after all
!               input expressions are read to make it easy to write expressions
!               to swap keys (see the EXAMPLES section).

!       able  to  the  user.  If the ttyModes resource in xterm is set as well,
!       all terminal emulator windows will use the same key for erasing charac-
!       ters:
!       %  xmodmap -e "keysym BackSpace = Delete"
!       %  echo "XTerm*ttyModes:  erase ^?" | xrdb -merge
